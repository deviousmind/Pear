# Pear
A simple tool for pairing

Can't figure out who to pair with tomorrow? <b>Meet Pear.</b><br />
Pear is a simple console app designed to create random pairs out of the pool of people you have available.
<br /><br />
What it does:
- Generate random pairs from availble people
- Prevent the same people from being paired together again if requested

What it does not:
- Remember your pool of people (although it may in the future)
- Match people based on strengths/weaknesses
