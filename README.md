# Pear
A simple tool for pairing

Can't figure out who to pair with tomorrow? <b>Meet Pear.</b><br />
Pear is a simple console app designed to create random pairs out of the pool of people you have available.
<br /><br />
What it does:
- Generates random pairs from available people as many times as you like
- Prevents the same people from being paired together again if requested
- Remembers your pool of people, and allows it to be changed, if requested
- Excludes missing people from your pool without needing to alter your saved people

What it does not:
- Match people based on strengths/weaknesses
- Solve interpersonal issues
- Provide any nutritional value

What it may do in the future:
- Allow for easier pool managment (add/remove people from your pool without having to recreate it)
- Include a UI (most likely another project)
